# Burnett for Charter
The entire Burnett for charter archive of information made public.

### Map files of the City Council Districts. 
You could spend a year emailing the city to get this data, or just download it here: https://github.com/elburnett/burnettforcharter/blob/main/PortlandCouncils.kmz

### Ready made district map
If you want to just use a pretty map, this one is ready made. Reach out if you want a different color. I made this using Mapbox and uploading the .kmz file above as a new layer in the Mapbox studio, then exporting it as an image file. https://github.com/elburnett/burnettforcharter/blob/main/districtmap2.png 

### Squirrel art files
These are created by Jon Diotalevi: http://www.jondiot.com/ in Adobe Illustrator. https://github.com/elburnett/burnettforcharter/blob/main/lawnsign%20left2%20(1)%20(1).ai
